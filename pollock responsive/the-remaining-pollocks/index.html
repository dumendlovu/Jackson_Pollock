    						<h2>Blue Poles - 1952</h2>
    						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/blue-poles.jpg" alt="Blue Poles">
    						<p>
    							Blue Poles, originally titled Number 11, 1952, is an abstract expressionist painting and one of
    							the most famous works by Jackson Pollock. It was purchased amid controversy by the National
    							Gallery of Australia in 1973 and today remains one of the gallery's major holdings.
    							<br><br>
    							At the time of the painting's creation, Pollock preferred not to assign names to his works, but
    							rather numbers; as such, the original title of Blue Poles was simply "Number 11"' or "No. 11" for
    							the year 1952. In 1954, the new title Blue Poles was first seen at an exhibition at the Sidney Janis
    							Gallery and reportedly originated from Pollock himself.
    							<br><br>
    							The painting has become one of the most popular exhibits in the gallery, for both its value as a major
    							work of 1950s abstract expressionism as well as its significance in Australian politics and history. For
    							Australians, the purchase of Blue Poles is still frequently cited by the Labor Party faithful as proof of
    							the wisdom of Gough Whitlam. Estimates of the painting's value vary widely, from $20 million to $100 million,
    							but its increased value has still shown it to have been a worthwhile purchase by financial standards.

    						<h2>Shimmering Substance - 1946</h2>
    						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/shimmer-sub.jpg" alt="Shimmering Substance">
    						<p>
    							In the late 1940s Pollock was among a group of young, mostly New York painters who became known
    							as abstract expressionists. They worked in a variety of styles, but generally shared a commitment
    							to creating large-scale, abstract works, an interest in Jungian psychological theories of the
    							collective unconscious and primitive mythology, and a belief that expressiveness was achieved,
    							in part, through the physical process of painting. Projecting the imprint of philosophy, art history,
    							and the human experience into visual form, these artists incorporated both chance and control while
    							painting with a physical immediacy and gesture. During the early 1950s two somewhat divergent
    							stylistic tendencies emerged within this movement: chromatic abstraction, as seen in the coloristic
    							paintings of Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman, and gestural abstraction or action painting, as exemplified
    							by the energetically brushed works of Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, and the poured paintings of
    							Jackson Pollock.
    							<br><br>
    							Shimmering Substance glows with the brilliant light of midday sun on a thick meadow. Alive with arcs
    							and orbs of heat-saturated colors, the painting channeled primal forces into radically new artistic
    							expression and was Pollock's next step in coming to terms with the inner turmoil that compelled him
    							to paint.

    						<h2>Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) - 1950</h2>
    						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/aut-rhyth.jpg" alt="Autumn Rhythm No30">
    						<p>
    							Pollock had created his first "drip" painting in 1947, the product of a radical new approach
    							to paint handling. With Autumn Rhythm, made in October of 1950, the artist is at the height
    							of his powers. In this nonrepresentational picture, thinned paint was applied to unprimed,
    							un-stretched canvas that lay flat on the floor rather than propped on an easel. Poured,
    							dripped, dribbled, scumbled, flicked, and splattered, the pigment was applied in the most
    							unorthodox means. The artist also used sticks, trowels, knives, in short, anything but the
    							traditional painter's implement to build up dense, lyrical compositions comprised of intricate
    							skeins of line. There's no central point of focus, no hierarchy of elements in this allover
    							composition in which every bit of the surface is equally significant. The artist worked with
    							the canvas flat on the floor, constantly moving all around it while applying the paint and working
    							from all four sides.

    						<h2>Number 1 (Lavender Mist) - 1950</h2>
    						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/lavender-mist.jpg" alt="Number 1 (Lavender Mist)">
    						<p>
    							Through his drip action technique, Pollock would create layers upon layers of paint,
    							created in a chaotic assemblage of drips and splashes. Physicists have studied
    							Pollock’s canvases, such as Lavender Mist, for fractals, which naturally occur out
    							of chaos. Chaos is defined as an irregularity of motion or shape that naturally arises
    							from deterministic forces (such as painting). Some art scientists, such as Richard Taylor,
    							have determined that the more chaotic Pollock’s drippings became, the closer they resembled
    							naturally occurring fractals, and that his chronologically later paintings displayed these
    							characteristics more so than his earlier works, which were less chaotic.

    						<h2>The She-Wolf - 1943</h2>
    						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/the-she-wolf.jpeg" alt="The She-Wolf">
    						<p>
    							The wolf in this painting may allude to the animal that suckled the twin
    							founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus, in the myth of the city's birth. But
    							"She-Wolf came into existence because I had to paint it", Pollock said in
    							1944. In an attitude typical of his generation, he added, "Any attempt on
    							my part to say something about it, to attempt explanation of the inexplicable,
    							could only destroy it" The She-Wolf was featured in Pollock's first solo
    							exhibition, at Art of This Century gallery in New York in 1943. MoMA acquired
    							the painting the following year, making it the first work by Pollock to enter
    							a museum collection.
								<br><br>
								When Pollock painted The She-Wolf he had not yet arrived at his so-called "drip"
								style, one of the great inventions of Abstract Expressionism. The canvas's traces
								of multicolored washes and spatters show that a free-form abstraction and an
								unfettered play of materials were already parts of his process; but in this work
								and others his focus is a compound of mythology and an iconography of the unconscious.
								(He was influenced here both by Surrealism and his own Jungian analysis.)

    						<h2>Guardians of the Secret - 1943</h2>
    						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/guardians_of_the_secret.png" alt="Guardians of the Secret">
    						<p>
    							Guardians of the Secret, often interpreted as a metaphor for the emergence
    							of unconscious impulses into conscious thought, represents a synthesis of
    							Pollock's sources. The imagery draws on African, Native American, as well
    							as prehistoric art, yet there are also touches of Miró and Picasso. The
    							abstract male and female 'guardians' have been interpreted in myriad ways:
    							as Northwest Indian totems; Egyptian gods; even as conflations of playing
    							cards and chess pieces wearing African masks. They flank the sides, while
    							along the bottom is a dog reminiscent of Anubis, the jackal-god of the
    							ancient Egyptian underworld. An African mask, a scarab-like embryo, and
    							a rooster, all line up like relics across the top. The rooster is a symbol
    							of fertility, but it may also recall the time Pollock lost the tip of his
    							finger as a child when he put his hand in the way of an axe meant to kill
    							a chicken. In the center of the composition is a tablet, covered in an
    							hieroglyphic inscription reminiscent of ancient tombs. When the canvas is
    							turned upside down, stick figures in various poses emerge. Oil on canvas -

    						<h2>Portrait and a Dream - 1953</h2>
    						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/port-and-a-dream.jpg" alt="Portrait and a Dream">
    						<p>
    							Pollock's magic as a painter is in his refusal to acknowledge a gulf
    							between his painting and himself. He spoke of being "in my painting".
    							His abstract art is not of the rational, ordering mind but of the
    							entire self. This painting, too, is brutally, hysterically a piece
    							of him. The portrait is a clumsy, violent thing, drawn in spiralling,
    							blotted black lines, with that one open jaded eye and a ridiculously
    							ham-fisted shape propped on a body that is too small - proof that
    							Pollock was no Norman Rockwell, no homely illustrator.
    							<br><br>
    							The head is almost attacked with colour: non-representational, ungainly
    							but incongruously alive colour. Transgressing the drawn border between
    							the face and its surroundings, Pollock's jarringly pretty grafts of
    							colour communicate discomfort and anguish, like the colour of Van Gogh.

    						<h2>Convergence - 1952</h2>
    						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/convergence.jpg" alt="Convergence">
    						<p>
    							Perhaps his most famous work was a painting entitled Convergence,
    							which was a collage of colors splattered on a canvas that created
    							masterful shapes and lines that evoke emotions and attack the eye.
    							<br><br>
    							Jackson Pollock's style of painting, as exemplified by Convergence,
    							is an important, innovative development in the history of painting.
    							At the time of the painting, the United States took very seriously
    							the threat of Communism and the cold war with Russia. Convergence
    							was the embodiment of free speech and freedom of expression. Pollock
    							threw mud in the face of convention and rebelled against the constraints
    							of societies oppressions. It was everything that America stood for all
    							rapped up in a messy, but deep package.
